      'Functional dependencies are crucial metadata for performing schema normalization, data cleaning and various data profiling tasks. A single FD represents a relationship between two disjoint sets of attributes, which states that the values from one set uniquely determine the values of another. Such hidden patterns provide a great start to get to know your data. This task discovers all FDs (either exact or approximate) contained in a provided table.',

    description:
      'Association rule is one of the most prominent concept of a frequent pattern mining. To mine association rules a dataset have to be presented in a transactional layout -- each record of such dataset is a unique transaction which contains items that were obtained during the transaction. At first, an AR mining algorithm defines frequently met items in a dataset, i.e. itemsets, and then constructs relationships between them according to specified confidence and support levels. Constructed relationships are binary and a single AR {X} => {Y} represents a fact that if itemset X was met in a transaction, then itemset Y can be met as well.',

    description:
      'Error detection pipeline is a built-in functionality for detecting typos and mispells which can prevent some functional dependency from holding on a dataset. In the first step, pipeline initiates process for approximate functional dependencies mining. Next, the user selects an approximate functional dependency that "almost" holds and inspect the differences in the right-hand side of a dependency among the cluster\'s tuples. Finally, the user chooses which values should be fixed and makes the corresponding changes.',

    label: 'Metric Dependency Verification',
    description:
      'Metric verification is a process of checking whether a specific metric functional dependency (MFD) holds on data or not. MFD is a relaxed form of classic functional dependencies which allows small variations in the values of the right hand side of a dependency. It other words, for MFD X‚ü∂Y we still expect two different tuples to agree on values of attributes in X, but their values on Y can differ no more than some threshold. MFD can be verified for numeric and string types using different metrics. Currently available are: Euclidean, Levenshtein and Cosine. Results of metric verification process are presented as clusters of records which share the same left hand side, but differ in the right one. If distance of records\' values too far from any points of the same cluster, they are tagged with an "X" mark. A check mark is used otherwise.',
